# Logs patterns
Created to automate the addition of short entries in large quantities.

## Log with counter
Adds entries, indexing them by incrementing the value of the previous one. New entries appear at the top, old entries are dropped to the bottom.

## Log calculating the difference
Adds records, indexed by the difference between the progressbar value and the last value when the last record was added.
